# etoh_attractordynamics_review
Code adapted from Jercog et. al. 2017
Jercog, D., Roxin, A., Barth√≥, P., Luczak, A., Compte, A., & de la Rocha, J. (2017). UP-DOWN cortical dynamics reflect state transitions in a bistable network. eLife, 6, e22425. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22425
Major changes include a MATLAB implementation rather than C++ and the addition of our EtOH variable to adjust UDS transitions.
